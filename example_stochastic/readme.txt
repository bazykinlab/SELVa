An example of using stochastic alelle change.
The initial landscape is set at random from a lognormal distribution with sigma = 0.5.  It is then changed at random times (Poisson with rate lambda = 1) to another landscape independently sampled from the same distribution.
Two parallel simulations are perfomed; in each, a group of five sites evolves according to the same landscapes.
