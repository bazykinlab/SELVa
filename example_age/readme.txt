This is an example of simulating a situation where the fitness of the current alele increases with time.
In particular, in this simulation, the program starts with a "flat" landscape and then the fitness of the current allele increases every 0.1 time steps by 0.1*1 = 0.1.
Five parallel single-position landscapes are simulated.
