#Print info on when and how landscape changes?
#This can seriously increase memory usage/slow down execution, so set it to true only if you need the info

PRINT_LANDSCAPE_INFO true

TREE_FILE simple.tre


#SHARED_LANDSCAPE is true if all branches _in_the_same_instance_ share the same landscape.
#false if each branch has its own landscape.  The default is false
SHARED_LANDSCAPE false


##### Advanced options #####
#Do we make the substitution rate constant (equal to tree branch length unit)?

CONSTANT_RATE true

#If the substitution rate is not constant, do we scale the landscape change rate to it?
SCALE_LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TO_SUBSTITUTION_RATE true


#How many threads should we use?
#num_threads <= num_instances/num_landscapes.  We currently do not have
#the functionality to multiithread a single instance/landscape histories.  The default is 1
NUM_THREADS 1

#how many independent landscapes do we have?
NUM_LANDSCAPES 3

#what is the length of a sequence (for one landscape instance?)
LENGTH 4

#INITIAL_FITNESS: {lognorm, gamma, file}
#if "file", specify FITNESS_FILE
#if "lognorm", specify SIGMA (mu is set to be 0)
#if "gamma", specify GAMMA_ALPHA and GAMMA_BETA (beta is set to be alpha, as is done by Yang)

#If INITIFAL FITNESS is set to file, specify its path here
FITNESS_FILE fitness_20aa_1_0.1.txt

# The parameter governing the landsacape probability distribution (if used)
#SIGMAM 1.0

#how do we change the fitness?  
#we could sample it from the same distribution as initial fitness (iid), 
#obtain it by randomly reshuffling the previous array (shuffle)
# or change the fitness of the current allele only (current_allele_dependent) in an age-dependent manner
#In the latter case, AGE_DEPENDENCE_COEFFICIENT must also be set
#NEW_FITNESS_RULE : {iid,  shuffle, current_allele_dependent}

#LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING selects the overall landscape change behavior
#when do we change the landscape?
#LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING (stochastic, fixed_num_intervals, fixed_interval_length, specified_branch_and_time)
#stochastically as a poisson process governed by the LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER (stochastic)
#at N fixed intervals, N = LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER (fixed_num_intervals)
#every LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER time units (fixed_interval_length)
#at branch and time specified in the CHANGE_BRANCH_TIME_FILE  (specified_branch_and_time).  The file namemust be given

LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING specified_branch_and_time

#Auxiliary parameter governing the specifics of the landscape change timing, its interpretation dependent on LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING

LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER 0.0

#The following parameter is needed if and only if LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING is set to current_allele_dependent
#if W = W_0+kt, where W is the fitness of the current allele, this is k (and LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_INTERVAL is t)
#AGE_DEPENDENCE_COEFFICIENT 0.01

#the following parameter is required if and only if the landscape should change
#at specified branch and time
#it should contain, on separate lines, node names _following_ the change and
#times remaining until those nodes (space separated)
