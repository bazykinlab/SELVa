DIST_PARAM 1

#how do we change the fitness?  
#we could sample it from the same distribution as initial fitness (iid), 
#obtain it by randomly reshuffling the previous array (shuffle)
# or change the fitness of the current allele only (current_allele_dependent) in an age-dependent manner
#In the latter case, AGE_DEPENDENCE_COEFFICIENT must also be set

###### The following parameters govern the timing of landscape changes
#LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING selects the overall landscape change behavior
#when do we change the landscape?
#LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING (stochastic, fixed_num_intervals, fixed_interval_length, specified_branch_and_time)
#stochastically as a poisson process governed by the LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER (stochastic)
#at N fixed intervals, N = LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER (fixed_num_intervals)
#every LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER time units (fixed_interval_length)
#at branch and time specified in the CHANGE_BRANCH_TIME_FILE  (specified_branch_and_time).  The file namemust be given

LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING specified_branch_and_time

#Auxiliary parameter governing the specifics of the landscape change timing, its interpretation dependent on LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING

LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_PARAMETER 0.0

#The following parameter is needed if and only if LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_TIMING is set to current_allele_dependent
#if W = W_0+kt, where W is the fitness of the current allele, this is k (and LANDSCAPE_CHANGE_INTERVAL is t)
#AGE_DEPENDENCE_COEFFICIENT 0.01

#the following parameter is required if and only if the landscape should change
#at specified branch and time
#it should contain, on separate lines, node names _following_ the change and
#times remaining until those nodes (space separated)

#SHARED_LANDSCAPE is true if all branches _in_the_same_instance_ share the same landscape.
#false if each branch has its own landscape.  The default is false
